==CIA Triad model==
Confidentiality, availability and integrity

'CIA triad' stands for Confidentiality, Integrity, and Availability. It is a common model that forms the basis for the development of secure systems.  

- **Confidentiality** - Confidentiality is to do with keeping an organisationâ€™s data private. This often means that only authorised users and processes should be able to access or modify data.
- **Integrity** - Integrity means that the data can be trusted. It means that it should be maintained in a correct state, kept so that it cannot be messed around with, it should be correct and also needs to be reliable.
- **Availability** - It's all well and good maintaining confidentiality and integrity but the data must be available to use. This means keeping systems, networks and devices up and running.

Being aware of these 3 concepts and how they overlap is important and as Stewart mentioned in the video, some organisations may lean more towards Confidentiality whilst others focus more on Availability depending on what their system or platform is being designed to do.

maps closely to intent

==Intent==
When an actor seeks to hack a system it does so with an intent

==How is intent different from motivation?==
Motivation is the why of the actor, intent is the end goal
