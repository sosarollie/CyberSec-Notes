- Stands for Adversarial Tactics, Techniques, and Common Knowledge
- Introduced by MITRE in 2013
- Covers each step of a cyber attack in detail in order to be analysed more in depth / efficiently
- Provides a clear roadmap of cyber attacks
- Better research capabilities on other possible cyber attacks

## Matrix
A visualization method used to classify and see attack methods of cyber attacks
Matrices can be customized for almost any subject and turned into useful visuals

Types
- Enterpreise
- Mobile
- ICS (Industrial Control Systems)

###### Enterprise Matrix
- The first one created
- has more digital systems and are more common than other matrices
- lot more info
- mainly used to understand the cyber attacks in larger orgs

There are 7 sub-matrices under the Enterprise Matrix:

- PRE
- Windows
- macOS
- Linux
- Cloud
- Network
- Containers

###### Mobile Matrix
- prepared for mobile devices
- used to ensure the security of individual and corporate mobile devices

Mobile Matrix has 2 sub-matrices:

- Android
- iOS

###### ICS Matrix
- contains info collected for the cysec of devices in the industrial control systems (used in industrial processes such as manufacturing, product handling, production, and distribution)

### Tactics
Expresses the purpose of the cyber attacker and the reasoning behind his actions
A tactic can be unique to a specific matrix but it could also be present in more than one

###### In Enterprise

There are 14 tactics in the Enterprise matrix :

- Reconnaissance
- Resource Development
- Initial Access
- Execution
- Persistence
- Privilege Escalation
- Defense Evasion
- Credential Access
- Discovery
- Lateral Movement
- Collection
- Command and Control
- Exfiltration
- Impact

###### In Mobile
There are 14 tactics in the Mobile matrix :

- Initial Access
- Execution
- Persistence
- Privilege Escalation
- Defense Evasion
- Credential Access
- Discovery
- Lateral Movement
- Collection
- Command and Control
- Exfiltration
- Impact
- Network Effects
- Remote Service Effects

###### In ICS
There are 12 tactics in the ICS matrix:

- Initial Access
- Execution
- Persistence
- Privilege Escalation
- Evasion
- Discovery
- Lateral Movement
- Collection
- Command and Control
- Inhibit Response Function
- Impair Process Control
- Impact

## Techniques and Sub-Techniques
They show the methods used by the attacker to achieve his goal and how exactly he conducted the attack

##### Procedure
Consists of usage examples of techniques/subtechniques, it shows which tool or software was utilized during the implementation of the technique

#### Mitigations
Refers to the measures and actions that can be taken in response to the techniques in matrices. Each mitigation has a unique ID name and description that provides clear understanding about them.

**Enterprise Mitigations**: [https://attack.mitre.org/mitigations/enterprise/](https://attack.mitre.org/mitigations/enterprise/)

**ICS Mitigations**: [https://attack.mitre.org/mitigations/ics/](https://attack.mitre.org/mitigations/ics/)


##### Groups
Advanced Persistent Threat (APT) groups are hacker groups that include many different known people that carry out cyber attacks in a targeted and systematic way (sometimes with government support)

#### Software
Information on software used by groups
