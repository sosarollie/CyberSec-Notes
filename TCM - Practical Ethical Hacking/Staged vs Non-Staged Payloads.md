##### Payloads
A payload is what we are going to run as an exploit

- Windows type payload
- Linux type payload
- Meterpeter payload

We send a payload to attempt to get a shell on the victim's machine

2 main types of payloads

- Non-staged
	- Sends exploit shellcode all at once
	- Larger in size and won't always work
- Staged
	- Sends payload in staged
	- Can be less stable

*Non staged and Staged*

the / lets us know that i's a staged payload

If a payload does not work, try the other type (assuming it's the right exploit)
