## Day 27/365
Before diving into modules, it would be helpful to clarify a few recurring concepts: vulnerability, exploit, and payload.

- **Exploit:** A piece of code that uses a vulnerability present on the target system.
- **Vulnerability:** A design, coding, or logic flaw affecting the target system. The exploitation of a vulnerability can result in disclosing confidential information or allowing the attacker to execute code on the target system.
- **Payload:** An exploit will take advantage of a vulnerability. However, if we want the exploit to have the result we want (gaining access to the target system, read confidential information, etc.), we need to use a payload. Payloads are the code that will run on the target system.

*Encoders*

Encoders will allow you to encode the exploit and payload in the hope that a signature-based antivirus solution may miss them.

Signature-based antivirus and security solutions have a database of known threats. They detect threats by comparing suspicious files to this database and raise an alert if there is a match. Thus encoders can have a limited success rate as antivirus solutions can perform additional checks.

*Payloads*
Codes that will run on the target system
Exlpoits will leverage a vuln on target system, but to achieve the desired result, we will need a payload
Examples
- getting a shell
- loading malware
- backdoor to the target system
- running a command (calc.exe as a benign proof of concept)

4 dif directories
- **Adapters:** An adapter wraps single payloads to convert them into different formats. For example, a normal single payload can be wrapped inside a Powershell adapter, which will make a single powershell command that will execute the payload.  
- **Singles:** Self-contained payloads (add user, launch notepad.exe, etc.) that do not need to download an additional component to run.
- **Stagers:** Responsible for setting up a connection channel between Metasploit and the target system. Useful when working with staged payloads. “Staged payloads” will first upload a stager on the target system then download the rest of the payload (stage). This provides some advantages as the initial size of the payload will be relatively small compared to the full payload sent at once.
- **Stages:** Downloaded by the stager. This will allow you to use larger sized payloads.

- generic/shell_reverse_tcp ---> inline or single payload  ( _ ) 
- windows/x64/shell/reverse_tcp ---> staged payload ( / )

### Commonly used parameters
- **RHOSTS:** “Remote host”, the IP address of the target system. A single IP address or a network range can be set. This will support the CIDR (Classless Inter-Domain Routing) notation (/24, /16, etc.) or a network range (10.10.10.x – 10.10.10.y). You can also use a file where targets are listed, one target per line using file:/path/of/the/target_file.txt, as you can see below.

- **RPORT:** “Remote port”, the port on the target system the vulnerable application is running on.
- **PAYLOAD:** The payload you will use with the exploit.
- **LHOST:** “Localhost”, the attacking machine (your AttackBox or Kali Linux) IP address.
- **LPORT:** “Local port”, the port you will use for the reverse shell to connect back to. This is a port on your attacking machine, and you can set it to any port not used by any other application.
- **SESSION:** Each connection established to the target system using Metasploit will have a session ID. You will use this with post-exploitation modules that will connect to the target system using an existing connection.

### Port Scanning

```shell-session
msf6 > search portscan
```

Options
- **CONCURRENCY:** Number of targets to be scanned simultaneously.
- **PORTS:** Port range to be scanned. Please note that 1-1000 here will not be the same as using Nmap with the default configuration. Nmap will scan the 1000 most used ports, while Metasploit will scan port numbers from 1 to 10000.
- **RHOSTS:** Target or target network to be scanned.
- **THREADS:** Number of threads that will be used simultaneously. More threads will result in faster scans.

`scanner/discovery/udp_sweep` module will allow you to quickly identify services running over the UDP

**SMB Scans**

Metasploit offers several useful auxiliary modules that allow us to scan specific services. Below is an example for the SMB. Especially useful in a corporate network would be `smb_enumshares` and `smb_version`
