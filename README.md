# CyberSec Notes
Personal notes from my Obsidian vault related to Cybersecurity, both blue and red-team concepts, exercises and explanations to help with my learning process (and hopefully someone else's too!)

- The Cybersecurity Folder displays notes in their original Obsidian format
- The Cybersecurity (PDF) Folder displays notes in PDF format (As some pasted photos wont be visible using the original formatting).

If you want to filter through and search for specific terms, It is also uploaded to [GitBook](https://jesuss-organization-13.gitbook.io/cybersec-notes))
