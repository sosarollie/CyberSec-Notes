# CyberSec Notes
Personal notes from my Obsidian vault related to Cybersecurity, both blue and red-team concepts, exercises and explanations to help with my learning process (and hopefully someone else's too!)

- The Cybersecurity Folder displays notes in their original Obsidian format
- The Pentester Journal displays notes in PDF format (As some pasted photos wont be visible using the original formatting).
