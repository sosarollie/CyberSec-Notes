#### Day 1/365.

Today, 22nd of January 2025 I began a new journey delving into Networking in order to learn the basics of connections and networks, critical to work in any job related to Cybersecurity.
Going through the Cisco Networking Academy, I was first tasked with learning and basic usage of a tool called Cisco Packet Tracer. PT simulates simple home networks, office networks or complex enterprise networks, I found its usage quite intriguing to say the least, connections can be made and explored both in a physical and logical way, serving as a great entry level tool to better understand the basics of network connections.
The modules contained videos that explained the basic usage of the platform, configurations, use cases and marked tasks. PC and Laptop interfaces come with a built-in Desktop system that simulates CLI usage.
I also learned the filetypes that PT works with, .pka, .pkt, .pksz, and .pkz.
Overall, this introductory module served its purpose as a "tour" of the platform, and I'm sure I will be slowly introduced into more advanced tasks in the coming days.
