# Network Topologies
Useful in Planning a new network
	Physical layout of a building or campus
Assists in understanding signal flow
	Troubleshooting problems

## Star or Hub and Spoke
Used in most large and small networks
All devices are connected to a central device
Switched Ethernet Networks
	-The switch is in the middle

## Ring
Used in many popular topologies
Still used in many
Metro Area Networks (MANs)
and Wide Area Networks (WANs)
- Dual rings
- Built-in fault tolerance

## Bus
Early local area networks
Coaxial cable was the bus
Running either through the walls or in the middle of the room, one single disconnect could cause an outage for everyone else
In CAN bus connections (inside cars) we still use them

## Mesh
Multiple links to the same place
Fully connected
Partially connected

Commonly used if creating Redundancy or fault-tolerance
Used in wide area networks (WANs)
Fully meshed and partially meshed

## Hybrid, more than one of these topology types working together

## Wireless topologies

#### Infrastructure
All devices communicate through an access point
The most common wireless com mode
#### Ad Hoc networking
No pre-existing infrastructure
Devices communication amongst themselves

#### Mesh
Ad hoc devices work together to form a mesh "cloud"
Like what controls lights, door locks, air conditioning systems in a house
Advantages: Allows mini devices to communicate with each other even if they are very far
Self form and self heal
