# Motherboards
Chipset
	- A group of integrated circuits or chips, that are designed to work together and are usually marketed as a single product.

Form Factor, ex. mAtx, ATX, ITX

Bus
	- One wire or group of wires that carry data from one place to another.

Lane
	- Two serial wires that enable the sending and receiving of data simultaneously
	
## Communication

Serial - Sending one bit of data at a time
	- - - - - - -
Parallel - Sending multiple bits of data at a time (2 or more)
	=======

# Chipsets

Two main chips controlling communication on a PC Motherboard

**Northbridge** (Fastest & responsible for high data transfer devices):
	Also called Memory Controller Hub (MCH)
	High speed Graphics
	Memory(RAM)

**Southbridge** (Secondary controllers)
	Also called I/O Controller Hub (ICH)
	input/output
	Hard drives, USB,  ethernet, etc.

Direct Media Interface (DMI) connects the two of them together

# Buses
Front Side Bus
	 CPU to Northbridge
Memory Bus
	Northbridge to memory slots
Expansion Bus
	All other
