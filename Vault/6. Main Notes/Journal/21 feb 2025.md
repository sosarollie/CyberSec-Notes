Had my first job interview today, and altough I was extremely nervous and could barely express myself in English I managed to pass, tomorrow I will do the exam part and be mostly ready to work in a job I really don't want to work at, but I think it will be temporary and a good chance to earn some needed cash.
Struggling with exactly a route to follow again, cybersec studying gives me some much needed routine, something to aspire to and a path to follow but I feel like there's still something missing.
I will also have to begin studying for finals, need to sit for at least 7 this year so I can clear the ones left from first year and turn page onto the next ones. I really want to graduate and I will have to work hard for it, I believe it will work out just fine.
